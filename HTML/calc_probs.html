      <h2>Details</h2>

      <p>For each site in a metacommunity, the function calculates a transition
matrix containing the probability that a microsite will changes states
during a single timestep. Microsites can be empty (0) or contain an
established host and symbiont (an 'association', given as an integer, 
<code>i</code>). For each potential association (given in <code>topo_names</code>), 
the function determines whether both host and symbiont are present in 
the species pools (<code>poolA</code> and <code>poolB</code>). If the host is not 
present, the association cannot establish (<code>P(0 -> i) = 0</code>). If both 
mutualists are present then the probability of an association forming is
given by <code>assoc_probs</code>, whereas if the symbiont is not present then
this probability is multiplied by <code>1 - omega</code>, which allows for 
facultative mutualism. Then, the probability that no association establishes
(<code>P(0 -> 0)</code>) is calculated as the product of the probabilities of  
each potential association failing to form. The remaining probability
is divided proportionally among each of the previously calculated
association probabilities (since the rows of a transition matrix must sum
to <code>1</code>). The probability that an association dies (<code>P(i -> 0)</code>)
is a constant that is the same for all associations (<code>mort_rate</code>) 
and there is no displacement of one association by another
(<code>P(i -> j) = 0</code>). However, the function could be modified to allow for
competitive displacement.</p>
