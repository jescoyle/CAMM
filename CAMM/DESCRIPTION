Description: The Community Assembly of Mutualists Model (CAMM) is a general
    simulation model of community assembly for multiple host and symbiont species.
    The purpose of building this model was to explore the consequences of obligate
    mutualism on diversity patterns along environmental gradients. This model
    extends previous niche-based community assembly models to two communities (hosts
    and symbionts) linked by an association network that defines which species
    pairs facilitate each others establishment. CAMM is a spatially implicit patch-
    occupancy model that represents an open meta-community with patches jointly
    distributed along two environmental gradients. Patches are comprised of a fixed
    number of microsites, each of which may be occupied by a host and its symbiont.
    Each patch also has a pool of unassociated host and symbiont species. The
    state of each microsite follows a discrete-time Markov process with transition
    probabilities determined by the presence of species in the pool of established
    an unassociated mutualists. The probability of species occuring in a patch's
    pool is determined by the match between species' niches and the environmental
    conditions in the patch as well as species' global abundances. Thus, the primary
    process built into the model is environmental filtering. Competition only occurs
    as microsite pre-emption and there are no differences in mortality among species
    or patches.
