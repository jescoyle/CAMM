Scripts used in the Community Assembly of Mutualists Model (CAMM). This is a simulation model that explores the consequences of obligate mutualism on diversity patterns along environmental gradients.

## Files
### ./R : Contains scripts for running the simulation in R
+ parameter_file.R : A file containing parameter values for one simulation run.
+ simulation_functions.R : Contains functions for initializing and running the simulation.
+ run_camm.R : The script used to run one implementation of the simulation.
+ analysis_function.R : Contains functions for analyzing simulation results.
